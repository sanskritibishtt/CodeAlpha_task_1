Heart Disease Prediction
Task 1:
Logistic Regression Heart Disease Prediction Model Summary
The Logistic Regression model is used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data.

Key steps:

Data Preparation: Features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators are preprocessed. Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.

Model Training: The Logistic Regression model is trained to classify patients into either a heart disease or no heart disease category. Hyperparameters like regularization strength (C) are tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, allowing for an understanding of how well it predicts heart disease.

The Logistic Regression model provides a clear and interpretable approach for predicting heart disease risk, helping identify individuals at higher risk based on key health metrics.
